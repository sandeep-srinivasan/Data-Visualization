# Visualization and Analysis of Deep Water Asteroid Impacts

# Abstract
The Deep Water Impact ensemble data set represents the study of asteroid impacts in deep ocean water. NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office is keenly interested to know the lower size limit of dangerous asteroids, so as to focus resources on finding all larger objects that potentially threaten the earth. Since most of the planet's surface is water, that is where asteroids will most likely impact. This observation has generated a serious debate over the last two decades on just how dangerous impact-induced waves or tsunamis are to populated shorelines.
Several asteroids of varying shapes, sizes and speeds are traveling in the solar system and have a potential to cause significant damages to all the living species of Earth when these asteroids enter the planet. Since large proportion of Earth consists of water, therefore the potential impact of asteroids is most likely to occur in the deep water and it results in the formation of tsunami. The severity of the impact of asteroids is dependent of number of parameters like the asteroid size, angle of impact, occurrence of airburst, time the asteroid spends in the atmosphere and the height from which the asteroid makes contact. Entry and breakup models indicate the airburst in the Earth’s atmosphere and the threats they impose. The main objective of this study is to analyze the asteroid impact simulations and to improve the understanding of the threats posed by the impact of the asteroids when they encounter the deep-water oceans.

# Introduction

The impact of asteroids is so devasting that they can cause mass extinctions of species, alter the plate tectonics, destroy ecosystems and cause variations in the climate. There are many such asteroids which might engage with Earth in the future that there has been extensive research conducted to study the hazards caused by such impacts and the intensity of such hazards. Since deflecting these asteroids is a near impossible task, therefore efforts have been made to understand the threats and ways to deal with them.  Since about 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered by water, the simulations concentrate on asteroid impacts in deep water oceans, which might lead to tsunamis. The IEEE Scientific
Visualization Contest 2018 deals with visually analysing the provided ensemble simulations that explore varying asteroid sizes, impact angles and airbursts.

In this project, the dataset available in ‘The 2018 IEEE SciVis Contest’ is utlized. This contest is dedicated to the visualization and analysis of deep water asteroid impacts. The data are generated from a simulation of the potential impact if an asteroid fall into the deep ocean water. The available datasets are generated from different initial simulation parameter (e.g. asteroid size, incoming angle and airburst or not). Each combination of initial simulation parameters produces a dataset with multiple time steps and each time step contains at least four attributes (prs, tev, v02, v03). All time steps generated by one specific combination of initial parameters are called a “ensemble member”.
The ensemble members ‘yc31’ (ensemble with airburst) and ‘ya31’ (ensemble without airburst) were analyzed with “300x300x300 Four Scalars Resolution” in these datasets.

# Methodology

The deep water impact ensemble data was analyzed using vtk. The code expects the dataset to have 4 scalars, ‘v03’, ‘v02’, ‘prs’, ‘tev’. By creating appropriate call back functions and by implementing key recognition, we have designed the following functionality:
1.	‘j’: Render previous time frame
2.	‘k’: Render next time frame
3.	‘a’: toggle water surface, i.e. a volume render of ‘v02’ scalar.
4.	‘s’: toggle asteroid, i.e. a volume render of ‘v03’ scalar.
5.	‘d’: toggle extreme heat surface, i.e. an iso surface for a tev value of 0.5.
6.	‘space’: take a screenshot of the current render window.

The figures of the appropriate color scales for both the volume renders are also plotted. The end product is a series of screenshots which we encoded as a GIF.

# Tasks

1. When does the airburst happen? Please pick up an ensemble member with airburst to answer this question. When the airburst happens, the asteroid is splits into multiple pieces.

The ensemble member chosen to analyse the point at which airburst occurs is yc31. Each timestamp index was rendered from 0 to 20. Each timestamp index has a time difference of 20 ms. The airburst occurs at timestamp index 5 of yc31 ensemble dataset at time = 100 ms and the screenshot to support this fact is as shown below,

2. When does the asteroid hit the water surface? Please pick up an ensemble member without airburst to answer this question.

The point at which the asteroid hits the water surface is analysed considering there is no airburst occurring.
The ensemble member chosen to analyse the point at which asteroid hits the water surface occurs is ya31. We rendered each timestamp index from 0 to 20. Each timestamp index has a time difference of 20 ms. The asteroid hits the water surface at timestamp index 8 of the ya31 ensemble dataset at time = 160 ms and the screenshot to support this fact is as shown below,

3.	The asteroid will influence the temperature in the region around the asteroid trajectory. When does the size of region with abnormal temperature caused by the asteroid reach its maximum and start to shrink?

Each timestamp index eas rendered which was a multiple of 10, i.e. 0, 10, 20, etc. Each timestamp index has a time difference of 20 ms. The point at which the size of the region with abnormal temperature in the asteroid reach its and start to shrink is at time = 1000 ms.
The ensemble member chosen to analyse the point at which the size of the region with abnormal temperature in the asteroid reach its and start to shrink is yc31. The screenshot to support this fact is as shown below,
